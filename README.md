# Polished Plushies and Silly Scrap

A mod adding silly scrap items that are designed to fit into Lethal Company (as much as silly plushies can), with all kinds of extra attention to detail.

Most of the scrap items added are plushies, which feature:

- Matching sewn and stitched textures to look less out-of-place among regular scrap (and each other)

- Optimized models (to the degree that I was able to) accounting for Lethal Company's generally lower-poly style and low resolution

- Squeezable interaction

- Some secret sound effects for every plushie, replicating the feel of a toy with a cheap speaker in it

- One or two items might also have some alternate forms for you to find...

There are also 2 special animated items, which feature:

- Animated skeletons with an idle animation and a set of randomly triggering animations

- Custom grabbing animations

- Periodic sound effects associated with these animations

- One item in particular also has some unique behaviours pertaining to speakers and walkie-talkies...

A lot of these are ported from, inspired by, or take bits and pieces from existing mods (generally pretty outdated ones, thus why this mod exists). Although some are highly modified, I didn't make any of the original models either.

So, I'll credit these mods and all the artists who made this possible in each item's section, and at the end in a full list.

### Thank you all very much!

Oh yeah I also did some stuff I guess. I'm ScienceBird, I've made some other moons and mods.

## Configuration

- **Configuration must be the same on all clients for everything to work normally and for sound effects to be synced** (I may look into implementing [CSync](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sigurd/CSync/) in the future)

- Items can be individually disabled (by default this only affects spawning, so be sure to enable `Only Load Enabled` if you want an item to not be loaded into the game at all)

- Items will spawn on all moons with a single configurable weight (these are set to be fairly rare by default, so getting a silly piece of scrap still feels special)

- Probability of a plushie's different sound effects triggering is adjustable (if probabilities total over 100, a random sound effect from the list will always play)

- The special animated items (Seal and Nuko) have their own special configuration options around their idle sound effects and how often they should perform animations

## Possible Issues

I've tested fairly thoroughly, but this mod ends up adding a lot of custom scripts and patches, so please report any strange behaviour. Some things to note:

- Sound effects, interactions, and animations *should* be synced for all clients, and if it becomes desynced, this should fix itself when another player connects or when landing on a moon.

- I'm not sure how all modded storage systems will interact with the plushies (specifically the randomness of their sound effects/animations), I've tested [SelfSortingStorage](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zigzag/SelfSortingStorage/) a bit, but nothing else.

- The animated items had some weird behaviours with vertical offsets (e.g. [Matty Fixes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mattymatty/Matty_Fixes/)) and general clipping due to the way the grab animation changes their mesh and position in the player's hands. I've patched the issues I came across, but let me know if any problems are persisting.
